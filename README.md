Overview :

This project implements a Fraction class in Python that supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of fractions. It automatically simplifies fractions and handles invalid inputs such as zero denominators.

Features :

Custom Fraction class with numerator and denominator<br>
Automatic simplification using Euclidâ€™s algorithm<br>
Operator overloading for +, -, *, and /<br>
String representation for easy printing<br>
Validation for zero denominators<br>

Learning Outcomes :

This project helped me deepen my understanding of object-oriented programming concepts in Python. It provided hands-on experience with special (dunder) methods like __init__, __add__, __sub__, and more, improving my skills in operator overloading and clean code design.

Usage Example : 

x = Fraction(5, 2) <br>
y = Fraction(3, 4)

print(x + y)  # Output: 13/4<br>
print(x - y)  # Output: 7/4<br>
print(x * y)  # Output: 15/8<br>
print(x / y)  # Output: 10/3
